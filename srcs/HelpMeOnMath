Me: Hi copilot !
Copilot: Hi, I'm a copilot.

Me: Can you help me with maths ?
Copilot: Yes, I can.

# Convert euler to vector

Me: How to convert a euler angle to vector with yaw pitch and roll.
Copilot: The formula is :
Copilot: v = [cos(yaw)*cos(pitch), sin(yaw)*cos(pitch), sin(pitch)]
Me: Thanks but why you don't use the roll ?
Copilot: Because I don't know how to convert a roll to a vector.
Me: Sure but the roll is in the euler angle then why ?
Copilot: Because the roll is a angle between the x axis and the x-y plane.
Me: Ok, and what is the yaw pitch ?
Copilot: The yaw is the angle between the z axis and the x-y plane.
Copilot: The pitch is the angle between the x-y plane and the x axis.
Me: Ok, thanks.
Me: What is the length of the calculated vector ?
Copilot: The length of the vector is the norm of the vector.
Me: Can you give me an example ?
Copilot: Yes, I can.
Copilot: Let's say you have a euler angle of [0, 0, 0].
Copilot: Then the vector is [1, 0, 0].
Me: and the length of the vector is 1 ?
Copilot: Yes, it is.
Me: Perfect, thanks.

# Convert velocity vector in km/h to m/s

Me: How to convert a velocity vector in km/h to m/s ?
Copilot: The formula is :
Copilot: v = v_kmh * 1000 / 3600
Me: Can you give me an example ?
Copilot: Yes, I can.
Copilot: Let's say you have v_kmh = [100, 100, 100].
Copilot: Then the velocity vector is [27.78, 27.78, 27.78] m/s.

# Add acceleration to velocity

Me: How to add acceleration in m/s2 to velocity vector in m/s ?
Copilot: The formula is :
Copilot: v1 = v0 + a*dt
Me: Can you give me an example ?
Copilot: Yes, I can.
Copilot: Let's say you have v0 = [10, 20, 30] m/s.
Copilot: And a = 10 m/s2.
Copilot: And dt = 1 s.
Copilot: Then the velocity vector is [20, 40, 60] m/s.

# Add velocity to position

Me: How to add velocity in m/s to position vector in m ?
Copilot: The formula is :
Copilot: p1 = p0 + v*dt
Me: Can you give me an example ?
Copilot: Yes, I can.
Copilot: Let's say you have p0 = [10, 20, 30] m.
Copilot: And v = [10, 20, 30] m/s.
Copilot: And dt = 1 s.
Copilot: Then the position vector is [20, 40, 60] m.

Me: Ok, thanks.

In euler angle what are each values ?
Copilot: The yaw is the angle between the z axis and the x-y plane.
Copilot: The pitch is the angle between the x-y plane and the x axis.
Copilot: The roll is the angle between the x axis and the x-y plane.
Me: and what is the order ?
Copilot: The order is yaw pitch roll.
Me: Ok, thanks.
